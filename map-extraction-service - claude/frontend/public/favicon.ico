The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon for the web application. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory.

Please ensure that you have a valid favicon image ready to be placed in `/map-extraction-service/map-extraction-service/frontend/public/favicon.ico`.
