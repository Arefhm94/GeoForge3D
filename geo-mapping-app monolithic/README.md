# Geo Mapping App

## Overview
The Geo Mapping App is a web application that allows users to interact with a world map. Users can search for locations, select different map layers, draw rectangles on the map, and extract geographic data in GeoJSON format. The application also provides functionality for user authentication, payment processing, and managing user orders.

## Features

- **GeoJSON Export**: Extract geographic data of the drawn rectangle in GeoJSON format.
- **Building Footprint Extraction**: Retrieve building footprints within the specified rectangle.
- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Payment Processing**: First 1 kmÂ² of data extraction is free; subsequent extractions are charged at $2 per square meter.
- **Order Management**: Users can view their order history and download extracted data.
